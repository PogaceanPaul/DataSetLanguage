# DataSetLanguage

This table contains the complete titles and relevant information about the texts that were used in the language detection project. In the article, these texts will be refered by their code as described in the table. 
For each text, we considered the title, authors, year of publication, language and provided the reader with a link to the original text. With this information we can determine a unique code for each piece of writing as follows:

- 2 capital letters describing the initials of the author's name
- 3 letters considered from the title. In most cases, they represent the first 3 letters in the title
- 2 letters that characterise the language in which the text is written, based on the standard ISO 839-1 notations (see https://xml.coverpages.org/iso639a.html and https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/English_list.php)
